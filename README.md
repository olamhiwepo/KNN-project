# A prediction of the target value of an unlabelled data  using K-Nearest Number

 This is a repository that contains the prediction of the target value of an unlabelled data. The dataset used in the project is also included in the repository
 
# Project's description

This project is aimed at predicting the target value of an unlabelled data based on the other columns available in the dataset which were anonymous to protect the dataof the company

# Installation

In building a linear regression model to predict the closing price of Tesla's stock, i used the following libraries
* pandas
* seaborn
* matplotlib
* Numpy
* sklearn

# Project methodology

* Data wrangling
* Scaling
* spliting the data into train and test
* Training the model
* Testing for the accuracy of the prediction model
* checking for the most suitable k-value to use
* Test for the accuracy of the most suitable k-value
* 
# Result

I got an accuracy of 75% for the k-value of 1 and an accuracy of 81% for the k-value of 7
